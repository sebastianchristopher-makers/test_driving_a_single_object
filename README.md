Project: TDD a single object

To achieve these goals:

I test-drive my code
I can work to a specification
I can write standards-compliant, clean object-oriented code
Action Plan

Apply what you have learned about TDD to building a single Dice object based on the following user stories.

As a board game player,
So that I can play a game
I want to be able to roll a dice

As a board game player,
So that I know how many steps I should move
Rolling a dice should give me a number between 1 and 6

As a dice app developer,
So that I give players a good game experience
I want the dice roll to be randomly picked

As a board game player,
So that I can play many types of games
I want to be able to roll any number of dice at the same time

As a board game player,
So that I know what my score was when I rolled several dice
I want to get the result of each dice roll

Your focus here should be on adopting a rigorous TDD process - Red, Green, Refactor.

Evidence Plan

You will feel more comfortable in your ability to explain all stages of the TDD process. (emotional evidence)

You will document the process you followed in order to build the Dice object. (empirical evidence)
